# (min)mod
A self-modifying language where everything is a stack of instructions.

Run using the path to the `.(m)m` program as the argument. To run in debug mode, add `-d` as a second argument.

The code isn't super beautiful, simply because the project wasn't big enough for me to bother cleaning up code.
