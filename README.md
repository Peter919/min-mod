# [min]mod
A self-modifying language where everything is a stack of instructions.

Run using the path to the `.[m]m` program as the argument. Undefine `NDEBUG` in `tools\debug.h` to run in debug mode.

The code isn't super beautiful, simply because the project wasn't big enough for me to bother cleaning up code.
